        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Look, if you haven't heard of dalgona coffee by now, you must be living under a rock. This fluffy drink has been EVERYWHERE on the internet for the last year. It takes some time to make, and you probably won't be whipping them up on a busy weekday, but it's a great way to elevate your regular cup of coffee into something special. And as a bonus, you probably already have all of the ingredients in your pantry already! Dalgona coffee is best when it's freshly made, as the foamy head deflates quickly - but trust me, once you make it, you're going to want to drink it immediately.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons instant coffee</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cold water</li>
            <li>Ice, for serving</li>
            <li>Milk of your choice, for serving</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium bowl, combine sugar, coffee, and water. Using a hand mixer or a whisk, vigorously whisk until mixture turns silky smooth and shiny, then continue whisking until it thickens and holds its lofty, foamy shape. (If whisking by hand, it will take 8 to 12 minutes to get to optimal fluffiness.)</li>
            <li>Fill a glass most of the way full with ice and milk, then dollop and swirl the whipped coffee mixture on top, mixing before drinking, if desired.</li>
        </ol>
