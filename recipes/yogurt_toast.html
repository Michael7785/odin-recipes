        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Chances are, if you've been on TikTok recently you've seen this viral new recipe for yogurt toast. The combination of yogurt and egg create a tasty and light custard that feels fancy but takes very little effort to prepare.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 thick slices of bread such as brioche, wheat or sourdough</li>
            <li>1/4 cup Greek yogurt</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons maple syrup, agave, honey, melted chocolate, or other sweet topping of your choice</li>
            <li>Fresh berries of your choice for topping</li>
            <li>Any other optional toppings of your choice (powdered sugar, toasted oats, dried coconut, chocolate shavings, etc)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an oven to 400 degrees or an air fryer to 375 degrees. In a medium bowl whisk yogurt, egg, maple syrup, and cinnamon.</li>
            <li>Using your fingers or the back of a spoon, press into the center of the bread to indent and create a well without tearing. Fill with custard mixture, dividing evenly between the slices. Top the custard with your berry (or mix of berries) of choice.</li>
            <li>If using an oven: Place prepared bread slices on a baking sheet and bake until the custard is set and the bread is golden brown, 10 to 13 minutes.</li>
            <li>If using an air fryer: Carefully place the prepared bread slices in the basket of your air fryer and cook until the custard is set and the bread is golden brown, 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer to a plate and drizzle with your topping of choice and optionally finish with a dusting of powdered sugar.</li>
        </ol>
